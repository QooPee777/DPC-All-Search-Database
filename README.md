# DPC All Search Database
- This database stores various data in the puzzle game "Tetris", such as perfect clear ("PC") rate, setup rate, number of PC solutions, etc., for the field with a 90% or higher rate of PC, obtained by mechanically searching all patterns of so-called "DPC" (precisely, "Temprate after 3-bags-PC" or "Template after 8-line-PC") (however, only for patterns where a leftover piece is placed on the first move).
- There are many leading DPCs that are not yet widely known, and Tetris players are encouraged to take advantage of them !
